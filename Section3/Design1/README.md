## Design 1

To implement a strategy for accessing the database based on the needs of various teams (Logistics, Analytics, and Sales), we can use role-based access control (RBAC) in PostgreSQL. RBAC can be used to assign specific privileges and permissions to roles, and then assign roles to users or groups of users.
